Other Language: [中文](README_zh.md)

**AnalyzeSoGradlePlugin** is a Gradle plugin for analyzing the source and architecture of Android so libraries, helping developers better understand the so files introduced by various dependencies in their project.



## Features

### Implemented
- Output the source and architecture information of so libraries
- Detect 16KB memory page size to help adapt to Android 15 requirements([Support 16 KB page sizes](https://developer.android.com/guide/practices/page-sizes))
- Beautiful HTML report output to quickly identify native libraries that are not compatible with Android 15 and their sources
- Add task to aggregate all variants and generate a combined HTML report
- Integrate with [LibChecker-Rules](https://github.com/LibChecker/LibChecker-Rules) database to provide more detailed library information in the HTML report

### Planned
- Issues and suggestions are welcome!

## Quick Start
**How to apply the Gradle plugin:**

This plugin is published on Maven Central:

${LAST_VERSION}: [![Download][version_icon]][version_link] (excluding 'v')

In your `build.gradle` file:

```kotlin
plugins {
    id("io.github.ravenliao.analyze-so") version "$LAST_VERSION"
}
```

## Usage

After applying the plugin, Gradle will automatically generate analysis tasks for each build variant:

```bash
# Analyze so files for a specific variant
./gradlew analyze[VariantName]So

# For example, analyze debug variant
./gradlew analyzeDebugSo

# Analyze so files for all variant
./gradlew analyzeSo
```

After running the analysis, the path to the detailed HTML report will be shown at the end of the task output. The report is typically located at:
```
app/build/reports/analyze-so/[VariantName]/analyze-so-report.html
```

For example, for the debug variant, the report will be at:
```
app/build/reports/analyze-so/Debug/analyze-so-report.html
```
